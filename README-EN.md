- Optimized GitHub Pages web version effect, convenient for mobile use


### 2025/07/28 - v2.0.2

- Refactored code
- Solved version number easily being missed for modification


### 2025/07/27 - v2.0.1

**Fixed Issues**:

1. Docker shell script line ending as CRLF causing execution exception issue
2. frequency_words.txt being empty causing news sending also empty logic issue
  - After fix, when you choose frequency_words.txt empty, will **push all news**, but limited by message push size, please adjust as follows
    - Option 1: Turn off mobile push, only choose GitHub Pages deployment (this is the way to get most complete info, will re-sort all platform trending by your **custom trending algorithm**)
    - Option 2: Reduce push platforms, prioritize **WeWork** or **Telegram**, these two pushes I made batch push feature (because batch push affects push experience, and only these two platforms give very little push capacity, so had to make batch push feature, but at least can ensure complete info)
    - Option 3: Can combine with Option 2, mode choose current or incremental can effectively reduce one-time push content


### 2025/07/17 - v2.0.0

**Major Refactoring**:
- Config management refactoring: All configs now managed through `config/config.yaml` file (main.py I still didn't split, convenient for you to copy and upgrade)
- Run mode upgrade: Supports three modes - `daily` (daily summary), `current` (current rankings), `incremental` (incremental monitoring)
- Docker support: Complete Docker deployment solution, supports containerized operation

**Config File Description**:
- `config/config.yaml` - Main config file (application settings, crawler config, notification config, platform config, etc.)
- `config/frequency_words.txt` - Keyword config (monitoring vocabulary settings)


### 2025/07/09 - v1.4.1

**New Feature**: Added incremental push (configure FOCUS_NEW_ONLY at top of main.py), this switch only cares about new topics not sustained heat, only sends notification when new content appears.

**Fixed Issue**: Under certain circumstances, some news containing special symbols caused occasional formatting exceptions.


### 2025/06/23 - v1.3.0

WeWork and Telegram push messages have length limits, I adopted splitting messages for pushing. Development docs see [WeWork](https://developer.work.weixin.qq.com/document/path/91770) and [Telegram](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api)


### 2025/06/21 - v1.2.1

Before this version, not only main.py needs copy replacement, crawler.yml also needs you to copy replacement

   <br>

   **Two Usage Methods:**

   ### Method 1: Free Use (Recommended for Beginners) 🆓

   **Features**:
   - ✅ No account registration, use immediately
   - ✅ 250 messages/day (enough for 90% users)
   - ✅ Topic name is "password" (need to choose hard-to-guess name)
   - ⚠️ Messages unencrypted, not for sensitive info, but suitable for our non-sensitive project info

   **Quick Start:**

   1. **Download ntfy App**:
      - Android: [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy) / [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.heckel.ntfy/)
      - iOS: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ntfy/id1625396347)

      ```
      Suggested format: trendradar-{your initials}-{random numbers}

      Cannot use Chinese

      ✅ Good example: trendradar-zs-8492
      ❌ Bad example: news, alerts (too easy to guess)
      ```

   3. **Configure GitHub Secret (⚠️ Name must match exactly)**:
      - **Name**: `NTFY_TOPIC` (Please copy and paste this name, do not type manually)
      - **Secret (Value)**: Fill in your subscribed topic name

      curl -d "Test message" ntfy.sh/your-topic-name
      ```

   ---

   ### Method 2: Self-Hosting (Complete Privacy Control) 🔒

   **Target Users**: Have server, pursue complete privacy, strong technical ability

   **Advantages**:
   - ✅ Completely open-source (Apache 2.0 + GPLv2)
   - ✅ Complete data self-control
   - ✅ No restrictions
   - ✅ Zero cost

   **Docker One-Click Deploy**:
   ```bash

     -v /var/cache/ntfy:/var/cache/ntfy \
     binwiederhier/ntfy \
     serve --cache-file /var/cache/ntfy/cache.db
   ```

   **Configure TrendRadar**:
   ```yaml
   NTFY_SERVER_URL: https://ntfy.yourdomain.com
   NTFY_TOPIC: trendradar-alerts  # Self-hosting can use simple name
   NTFY_TOKEN: tk_your_token  # Optional: Enable access control
   ```

   **Subscribe in App**:
   - Click "Use another server"
   - Enter your server address
   - Enter topic name
   - (Optional) Enter login credentials

   ---

   **FAQ:**

   <details>
   <summary><strong>Q1: Is the free version enough?</strong></summary>

   250 messages/day is enough for most users. With 30-minute crawl intervals, about 48 pushes/day, completely sufficient.
   </details>

   <details>
   <summary><strong>Q2: Is the Topic name really secure?</strong></summary>

   If you choose a random, sufficiently long name (like `trendradar-zs-8492-news`), brute force is nearly impossible:
   - ntfy has strict rate limiting (1 request/second)
   - 64 character choices (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _, -)
   - 10 random characters have 64^10 possibilities (would take years to crack)
   </details>

   ---

   **Recommended Choice:**

   | User Type | Recommended | Reason |
   |-----------|-------------|--------|
   | Regular Users | Method 1 (Free) | Simple, fast, enough |
   | Technical Users | Method 2 (Self-Host) | Complete control, unlimited |
   | High-Frequency Users | Method 3 (Paid) | Check official website |

   > **💡 Beginner Quick Start Tip**:
   >
   > For first deployment, suggest completing **GitHub Secrets** configuration first (choose one push platform), then jump to [Step 3] to test push success.
   >
   > **Don't modify** `config/config.yaml` and `frequency_words.txt` temporarily, adjust these configs after push test succeeds as needed.


3. **Manual Test News Push**:

   > 💡 **Complete Step 1-2 first, then test immediately!** Test success first, then adjust configuration (Step 4) as needed.
   >
   > ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Enter your own forked project, not this project!**

   **How to find your Actions page**:

   - **Method 1**: Open your forked project homepage, click the **Actions** tab at the top
   - **Method 2**: Direct access `https://github.com/YourUsername/TrendRadar/actions`

   **Example comparison**:
   - ❌ Author's project: `https://github.com/sansan0/TrendRadar/actions`

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

> **📖 Reminder**: This chapter provides detailed configuration explanations. Suggest completing [Quick Start](#-quick-start) basic configuration first, then refer to detailed options here as needed.

### 1. Platform Configuration

<details id="custom-monitoring-platforms">
<summary>👉 Click to expand: <strong>Custom Monitoring Platforms</strong></summary>
<br>

This project's news data comes from [newsnow](https://github.com/ourongxing/newsnow). You can click the [website](https://newsnow.busiyi.world/), click [More], to see if there are platforms you want.

For specific additions, visit [project source code](https://github.com/ourongxing/newsnow/tree/main/server/sources), based on the file names there, modify the `platforms` configuration in `config/config.yaml` file:

```yaml
platforms:
  - id: "toutiao"
    name: "Toutiao"
  - id: "baidu"
    name: "Baidu Hot Search"
  - id: "wallstreetcn-hot"
    name: "Wallstreetcn"
  # Add more platforms...
```

</details>

### 2. Keyword Configuration

<details id="frequencywordstxt-configuration-tutorial">
<summary>👉 Click to expand: <strong>frequency_words.txt Configuration Tutorial</strong></summary>
<br>

Configure monitoring keywords in `frequency_words.txt` with three syntax types and grouping features.

Keywords at the top have higher priority. Adjust keyword order based on your interests.

| Syntax Type | Symbol | Purpose | Example | Matching Logic |
|------------|--------|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Normal** | None | Basic matching | `Huawei` | Match any one |
| **Required** | `+` | Scope limiting | `+phone` | Must include both |
| **Filter** | `!` | Noise exclusion | `!ad` | Exclude if included |

#### 📋 Basic Syntax

##### 1. **Normal Keywords** - Basic Matching
```txt
Huawei
OPPO
Apple
```
**Effect:** News containing **any one** of these words will be captured

##### 2. **Required Words** `+word` - Scope Limiting
```txt
Huawei
OPPO
+phone
```
**Effect:** Must include both normal word **and** required word to be captured

##### 3. **Filter Words** `!word` - Noise Exclusion
```txt
Apple
Huawei
!fruit
!price
```
**Effect:** News containing filter words will be **excluded**, even if it contains keywords

#### 🔗 Group Feature - Importance of Empty Lines

**Core Rule:** Use **empty lines** to separate different groups, each group is independently counted

##### Example Configuration:
```txt
iPhone
Huawei
OPPO
+launch

A-shares
Shanghai Index
Shenzhen Index
+fluctuation
!prediction

World Cup
Euro Cup
Asian Cup
+match
```

##### Group Explanation and Matching Effects:

**Group 1 - Phone Launches:**
- Keywords: iPhone, Huawei, OPPO
- Required: launch
- Effect: Must include phone brand name and "launch"

**Matching Examples:**
- ✅ "iPhone 15 officially launched with pricing" ← Has "iPhone" + "launch"
- ✅ "Huawei Mate60 series launch livestream" ← Has "Huawei" + "launch"
- ✅ "OPPO Find X7 launch date confirmed" ← Has "OPPO" + "launch"
- ❌ "iPhone sales hit record high" ← Has "iPhone" but missing "launch"

**Group 2 - Stock Market:**
- Keywords: A-shares, Shanghai Index, Shenzhen Index
- Required: fluctuation
- Filter: prediction
- Effect: Include stock-related words and "fluctuation", but exclude "prediction"

**Matching Examples:**
- ✅ "A-shares major fluctuation analysis today" ← Has "A-shares" + "fluctuation"
- ✅ "Shanghai Index fluctuation reasons explained" ← Has "Shanghai Index" + "fluctuation"
- ❌ "Experts predict A-shares fluctuation trends" ← Has "A-shares" + "fluctuation" but contains "prediction"
- ❌ "A-shares trading volume hits new high" ← Has "A-shares" but missing "fluctuation"

**Group 3 - Football Events:**
- Keywords: World Cup, Euro Cup, Asian Cup
- Required: match
- Effect: Must include cup name and "match"

**Matching Examples:**
- ✅ "World Cup group stage match results" ← Has "World Cup" + "match"
- ✅ "Euro Cup final match time" ← Has "Euro Cup" + "match"
- ❌ "World Cup tickets on sale" ← Has "World Cup" but missing "match"

#### 🎯 Configuration Tips

##### 1. **From Broad to Strict Strategy**
```txt
# Step 1: Start with broad keywords for testing
Artificial Intelligence
AI
ChatGPT

# Step 2: After finding mismatches, add required words
Artificial Intelligence
AI
ChatGPT
+technology

# Step 3: After finding noise, add filter words
Artificial Intelligence
AI
ChatGPT
+technology
!advertisement
!training
```

##### 2. **Avoid Over-Complexity**
❌ **Not Recommended:** Too many words in one group
```txt
Huawei
OPPO
Apple
Samsung
vivo
OnePlus
Meizu
+phone
+launch
+sales
!fake
!repair
!second-hand
```

��� **Recommended:** Split into precise groups
```txt
Huawei
OPPO
+new product

Apple
Samsung
+launch

phone
sales
+market
```

### 3. Push Mode Details

<details>
<summary>👉 Click to expand: <strong>Three Push Modes Detailed Comparison</strong></summary>
<br>

#### Detailed Comparison Table

| Mode | Target Users | Push Timing | Display Content | Typical Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Daily Summary**<br/>`daily` | 📋 Managers/Regular Users | Scheduled push (default hourly) | All matched news of the day<br/>+ New news section | **Example**: Check all important news of the day at 6 PM<br/>**Feature**: See full-day trend, don't miss any hot topic<br/>**Note**: Will include previously pushed news |
| **Current Rankings**<br/>`current` | 📰 Content Creators | Scheduled push (default hourly) | Current ranking matches<br/>+ New news section | **Example**: Track "which topics are hottest now" hourly<br/>**Feature**: Real-time understanding of current popularity ranking changes<br/>**Note**: Continuously ranked news appear each time |
| **Incremental Monitor**<br/>`incremental` | 📈 Traders/Investors | Push only when new | Newly appeared frequency word matches | **Example**: Monitor "Tesla", only notify when new news appears<br/>**Feature**: Zero duplication, only see first-time news<br/>**Suitable for**: High-frequency monitoring, avoid information disturbance |

#### Actual Push Effect Example

Assume you monitor "Apple" keyword, execute once per hour:

| Time | daily Mode Push | current Mode Push | incremental Mode Push |
|-----|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 10:00 | News A, News B | News A, News B | News A, News B |
| 11:00 | News A, News B, News C | News B, News C, News D | **Only** News C |
| 12:00 | News A, News B, News C | News C, News D, News E | **Only** News D, News E |

**Explanation**:
- `daily`: Cumulative display of all news of the day (A, B, C all retained)
- `current`: Display current ranking news (ranking changed, News D on list, News A off list)
- `incremental`: **Only push newly appeared news** (avoid duplicate disturbance)

#### Common Questions

> **💡 Encountered this problem?** 👉 "Execute once per hour, news output in first execution still appears in next hour execution"
> - **Reason**: You might have selected `daily` (Daily Summary) or `current` (Current Rankings) mode
> - **Solution**: Change to `incremental` (Incremental Monitor) mode, only push new content

</details>

### 4. Advanced Configuration - Hotspot Weight Adjustment

<details>
<summary>👉 Click to expand: <strong>Hotspot Weight Adjustment</strong></summary>
<br>

Current default configuration is balanced.

#### Two Core Scenarios

**Real-Time Trending Type**:
```yaml
weight:
  rank_weight: 0.8    # Mainly focus on ranking
  frequency_weight: 0.1  # Less concern about continuity
  hotness_weight: 0.1
```
**Target Users**: Content creators, marketers, users wanting to quickly understand current hot topics

**In-Depth Topic Type**:
```yaml
weight:
  rank_weight: 0.4    # Moderate ranking focus
  frequency_weight: 0.5  # Emphasize sustained heat within the day
  hotness_weight: 0.1
```
**Target Users**: Investors, researchers, journalists, users needing deep trend analysis

#### Adjustment Method
1. **Three numbers must sum to 1.0**
2. **Increase what's important**: Increase rank_weight for rankings, frequency_weight for continuity
3. **Suggest adjusting 0.1-0.2 at a time**, observe effects

Core idea: Users pursuing speed and timeliness increase ranking weight, users pursuing depth and stability increase frequency weight.

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

#### Method 1: Quick Experience (One-Line Command)

**Linux/macOS System:**
```bash
# Create config directory and download config files
mkdir -p config output
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sansan0/TrendRadar/master/config/config.yaml -P config/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sansan0/TrendRadar/master/config/frequency_words.txt -P config/
```
Or **Manual Creation**:
1. Create `config` folder in current directory
2. Download config files:
   - Visit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sansan0/TrendRadar/master/config/config.yaml → Right-click "Save As" → Save to `config\config.yaml`
   - Visit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sansan0/TrendRadar/master/config/frequency_words.txt → Right-click "Save As" → Save to `config\frequency_words.txt`

Final directory structure should be:
```
current directory/
└── config/
    ├── config.yaml
    └── frequency_words.txt
```

```bash
docker run -d --name trend-radar \
  -v ./config:/app/config:ro \
  -v ./output:/app/output \
  -e FEISHU_WEBHOOK_URL="your feishu webhook" \
  -e DINGTALK_WEBHOOK_URL="your dingtalk webhook" \
  -e WEWORK_WEBHOOK_URL="your wework webhook" \
  -e TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your telegram_bot_token" \
  -e TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="your telegram_chat_id" \
  -e EMAIL_FROM="your sender email" \
  -e EMAIL_PASSWORD="your email password or auth code" \
  -e EMAIL_TO="recipient email" \
  -e CRON_SCHEDULE="*/30 * * * *" \
  -e RUN_MODE="cron" \
  -e IMMEDIATE_RUN="true" \
  wantcat/trendradar:latest
```

#### Method 2: Using docker-compose (Recommended)

1. **Create Project Directory and Config**:
   ```bash
   # Create directory structure
   mkdir -p trendradar/{config,docker}
   cd trendradar

   # Download config file templates
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sansan0/TrendRadar/master/config/config.yaml -P config/
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sansan0/TrendRadar/master/config/frequency_words.txt -P config/

   # Download docker-compose config
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sansan0/TrendRadar/master/docker/.env
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sansan0/TrendRadar/master/docker/docker-compose.yml
   ```

Final directory structure should be:
```
current directory/
├── config/
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── frequency_words.txt
└── docker/
    ├── .env
    └── docker-compose.yml
```

2. **Config File Description**:
   - `config/config.yaml` - Application main config (report mode, push settings, etc.)
   - `config/frequency_words.txt` - Keyword config (set your interested trending keywords)
   - `.env` - Environment variable config (webhook URLs and scheduled tasks)

   **⚙️ Environment Variable Override Mechanism (v3.0.5+)**

   If you encounter **config.yaml modifications not taking effect** in NAS or other Docker environments, you can directly override configs via environment variables:

   | Environment Variable | Corresponding Config | Example Value | Description |
   |---------------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------|
   | `ENABLE_CRAWLER` | `crawler.enable_crawler` | `true` / `false` | Enable crawler |
   | `ENABLE_NOTIFICATION` | `notification.enable_notification` | `true` / `false` | Enable notification |
   | `REPORT_MODE` | `report.mode` | `daily` / `incremental` / `current`| Report mode |
   | `PUSH_WINDOW_ENABLED` | `notification.push_window.enabled` | `true` / `false` | Push time window switch |
   | `PUSH_WINDOW_START` | `notification.push_window.time_range.start` | `08:00` | Push start time |
   | `PUSH_WINDOW_END` | `notification.push_window.time_range.end` | `22:00` | Push end time |
   | `FEISHU_WEBHOOK_URL` | `notification.webhooks.feishu_url` | `https://...` | Feishu Webhook |

   **Config Priority**: Environment Variables > config.yaml

   **Usage Method**:
   - Modify `.env` file, uncomment and fill in needed configs
   - Or add directly in NAS/Synology Docker management interface's "Environment Variables"
   - Restart container to take effect: `docker-compose restart`


3. **Start Service**:
   ```bash
   # Pull latest image and start
   docker-compose pull
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Check Running Status**:
   ```bash
   # View logs
   docker logs -f trend-radar

   # View container status
   docker ps | grep trend-radar
   ```

#### Method 3: Local Build (Developer Option)

If you need custom code modifications or build your own image:

```bash
# Clone project
git clone https://github.com/sansan0/TrendRadar.git
cd TrendRadar

# Modify config files
vim config/config.yaml
vim config/frequency_words.txt

# Use build version docker-compose
cd docker
cp docker-compose-build.yml docker-compose.yml

# Build and start
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Image Update

```bash
# Method 1: Manual update
docker pull wantcat/trendradar:latest
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# Method 2: Using docker-compose update
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Service Management Commands

```bash
# View running status
docker exec -it trend-radar python manage.py status

# Manually execute crawler once
docker exec -it trend-radar python manage.py run

# View real-time logs
docker exec -it trend-radar python manage.py logs

# Display current config
docker exec -it trend-radar python manage.py config

# Display output files
docker exec -it trend-radar python manage.py files

# View help info
docker exec -it trend-radar python manage.py help

# Restart container
docker restart trend-radar

# Stop container
docker stop trend-radar

# Remove container (keep data)
docker rm trend-radar
```

#### Data Persistence

Generated reports and data are saved in `./output` directory by default. Data persists even if container is restarted or removed.

#### Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check container status
docker inspect trend-radar

# View container logs
docker logs --tail 100 trend-radar

# Enter container for debugging
docker exec -it trend-radar /bin/bash

# Verify config files
docker exec -it trend-radar ls -la /app/config/
```


## 🤖 AI Analysis

TrendRadar v3.0.0 added **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** based AI analysis feature, allowing natural language conversations with news data for deep analysis.


### ⚠️ Important Notice Before Use


**Critical: AI features require local news data support**

AI analysis **does not** query real-time online data directly, but analyzes **locally accumulated news data** (stored in the `output` folder)


#### Usage Instructions:

1. **Built-in Test Data**: The `output` directory includes news data from **November 1-15, 2025** by default for quick feature testing

2. **Query Limitations**:
   - ✅ Only query data within available date range (Nov 1-15)
   - ❌ Cannot query real-time news or future dates

3. **Getting Latest Data**:
   - Test data is for quick experience only, **recommend deploying the project yourself** to get real-time data
   - Follow [Quick Start](#-quick-start) to deploy and run the project
   - After accumulating news data for at least 1 day, you can query the latest trending topics
